# ðŸ«€ Heart Disease Prediction

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease in a patient using **Machine Learning** models trained on health-related parameters such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, etc.
The goal is early detection to help in timely medical intervention.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset appears to be based on the **Heart Disease UCI dataset** (Cleveland Clinic Foundation).  
It includes patient features such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Serum cholesterol
- Fasting blood sugar
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exercise-induced angina
- ST depression (oldpeak)
- Slope, CA, Thal
- Target (1 = heart disease, 0 = no heart disease)




## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
